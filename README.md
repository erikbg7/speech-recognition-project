# Speech Recognition Project

This side project main objective is to allow the creation of an invoice of a defined set of products for a client.

The basic behaviour can be described as follows:
- Use Google TTS to convert audio input to text
- Process the output text to maximize the results
- Apply NER to extract a set of entities (clients, products, dates) from the text
- Build an Invoice in real time
